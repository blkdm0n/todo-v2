# todo-v2

# todo-v1
More complex implementation of Version 1 incorporating functions todo

Basic Requirements:
[X] It should have a function to display todos
[X] It should have a function to add new todos
[X] It should have a function to change a todo   <= optimize UX for search by todo item not index
[X] It should have a function to delete a todo   <= optimize UX for search by todo item not index

Version 2 Complete

Things to think about?
1.  How and when should I optimize?  Given the optimizations weren't that complex, I don't think I wasted any time by doing them before completing the final version.  But under pressure there might be some time-sensitive trade offs of stopping to optimize before you have at least an MVP.
